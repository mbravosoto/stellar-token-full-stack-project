# stellar-token-full-stack-project
This project combines a CAP-46 compliant Soroban smart contract designed to create and manage a token on the Stellar Testnet, a frontend built with Scaffold Stellar, and Freighter wallet integration for secure user authentication. It allows users to retrieve and display their token balance in real time.
